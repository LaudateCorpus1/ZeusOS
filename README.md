### README.md

This JavaFX project was made to emulate the state of a computer, including the implementation of a Desktop, Internal Windows and File system. The project 
was discontinued during the development of the Memory Management system in order to pursue classes at UC Berkeley and Ohlone as well as prospective internships.
The idea was likely to vast for one person to develop in the first place, but perhaps I will return to complete the project in future years.
ZeusOS holds the current developed project files and the /proj folder holds some of the initial ideas to translate native Java File language into familiar
Classes and Functions.
