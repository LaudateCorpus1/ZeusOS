Recently just completed the Drag Interface of InternalWindow
Just made the Notepad.xml, now working on Notepad.java,
which is similar to Default Internal Window, So make the copy
Paste. Try to make a Notepad show on screen

Next steps:
Develop the class Icon, which takes a name, Image, and displays
Icon. On double click (From desktop.fxml), spawn an internal frame
object with getChildren().add(node). Add functionality to 
save Notepad info into the Desktop info, and try to create Checkpoints.


Later Steps:
Create a fully fledged Desktop, and continue the notes on the Google Doc.
